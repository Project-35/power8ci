CARD: As a system administrator, I want an easy to install CI system so that I can get up and running quickly and focus on other things.

CONVERSATION: Our chosen deployment system (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) should handle upgrades.

CONVERSATION: While we should have reasonable defaults, our deployment/cm system should allow others to override/change settings. Also,
to the extent possible, all configuration should live within the cm system.
