User stories as beginning point for design document


Lee:
Probably combine these {
CARD: As a system administrator, I want an easy to install CI system so that I can get up and running quickly and focus on other things.
CONVERSATION: Possibly create an install using Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or other configuration management system.
CONFIRMATION: Ansible playbook, Chef cookbook, or similar exists and has been tested to work in deploying the CI system.

CARD: As a system administrator, I want an easy to upgrade CI system, so that bugs can be fixed easily.
CONVERSATION: Our chosen deployment system (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) should handle upgrades.
CONFIRMATION: Ansible playbook, Chef cookbook, or similar exists and has been tested to work in upgrading the CI system.

CARD: As a system administrator, I want a configurable system, so that I can make changes that better fit my setup.
CONVERSATION: While we should have reasonable defaults, our deployment/cm system should allow others to override/change settings. Also,
to the extent possible, all configuration should live within the cm system.
CONFIRMATION: We should be able to test that changes to the system can be easily done and deployed.
}

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to be able to automatically build and test my software on POWER8. (need better wording)
CONVERSATION: Use Jenkins to create a POWER8 Continuous Integration system. (specify how Jenkins allows us to do this)
CONFIRMATION: 

CARD: As a system administrator, I want to be able to manage the creation and removal of virtual machines and containers.
CONVERSATION: Use OpenStack.
CONFIRMATION:

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to be able to register to use the CI system so that I can build and test my software.
CONVERSATION: We should have a web site that a developer can register on.
CONFIRMATION: Web site should exist that allows a developer to register.

Derek:
CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to be able to use an existing login so that I don't have yet another login to keep track of.
CONVERSATION: Pluggable authentication. Allow user to use login credentials from other sites such as GitHub, Google, etc... to login.
CONFIRMATION: Our registration web site should allow a developer to choose from multiple options for authentication when registering.

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to be able to configure a repository to be built.
CONVERSATION: Focus on GitHub. Possibly other git repositories. Possibly other vcs repositories as well. May depend on Jenkins plugins.
CONFIRMATION: Developer should be able to specify the repository they want built.

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to see the progress of my build so that I know when my project will be completed.
CONVERSATION:
CONFIRMATION:

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to access the built and tested files.
CONVERSATION: Developers need to be able to access the created binaries and other files from building the source code, so that they may
be able to distribute them as needed on their own.
CONFIRMATION: The files can be downloaded from the website.

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want to configure the build and testing environment and methods.
CONVERSATION: Each repository needs a way to configure things such as required packages for building and command-line arguments.
To that end, the system will require a configuration file in YAML format. This file will contain information such as necessary
libraries and packages, programs and command-line arguments for building, and how to test the built code.
CONFIRMATION: The system checks for a file called ".powerci.yml" in registered repositories and configures the build environment with it.

CARD: As an open source software developer, I want the system to automatically run builds when a commit is made to the repository.
CONVERSATION: Developers require a system that will automatically pull, build and test so they can always have the most current
binaries available and so they can quickly know if a recent change causes the build to fail. Jenkins has plugin support for polling
Git repositories for changes and then executing a pull-build-test-deploy sequence when a commit is detected to have been pushed since
the last build was ran.
CONFIRMATION: The system automatically executes a pull-build-test-deploy sequence when a commit is pushed to the Git repository.

CARD: As a system administrator, I want the system to use pre-built images for the base system of VMs.
CONVERSATION: Pre-built images that are used for spinning up VMs makes the entire process of deploying and configuring a VM
for running a pull-build-test sequence much faster and smoother. Ubuntu will probably be the OS of choice for the base images, however
we may look into providing images for other Linux distributions.
CONFIRMATION: The system uses disk images with Linux installed for starting VMs.
