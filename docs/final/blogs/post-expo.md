If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself?          
If I could redo the project from Fall term I would start my project earlier and have a detailed plan of what we need to do. One of the key problems we ran into was splitting up work between my team members. We didn't have a good workflow and things got done slow because of it. During winter term, our client suggested us to come up with a list of task to accomplish and that workflow was much better than the one we previously had.

What's the biggest skill you've learned? What skills do you see yourself using in the future?              
I learned a lot about communication and teamwork. It is very valuable life skill that I can apply to anywhere in the future. In a development team, having good communication is what gets work done and having a good workflow. Having a well defined plan of goals and milestone can greatly improve efficiency. I will be applying all the skills I learned in my future job as a software developer. I also learned a lot of Jenkins as well. Jenkins is used by many development team because continuous integration is a very useful tool in developing software.  

What did you like about the project, and what did you not?             
I liked that our project involves Jenkins because my previous job was using this and I could easily relate to it. I also got to learn more about what it does. I didn't like that our project didn't involve much coding because that was what I was hoping to do from the start.

What did you learn from your teammates?           
I learned new technologies from my teammates that I didn't know existed, such as ansible and openstack. 

If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done?             
I would be satisfied with the work done. We have a functional continuous integration system which is what the goal of this project is. There can be more improvements made, but what we have now is sufficient.
 
If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be working on?             
There can be more testing done to our system and just general refinement. We could add more features or just have a more secure system.***If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself?***

Focus on the project workflow. Set deadlines and meet them. Use a task management system from the beginning. Set aside time in the Fall to make sure everyone on the project has a basic understanding of all the technical areas. Always communicate with team members and client. 

***What's the biggest skill you've learned?***

Something that we didn't do terribly well in the beginning, but I think got better at as we went. Being able to see what tasks need to be done from the goals that are set, and then breaking up tasks into individual assignments to meet those goals.

***What skills do you see yourself using in the future?***

Technical: Ansible and configuration management in general.

Non-technical: Project coordination. Working with teammates.

***What did you like about the project, and what did you not?***

I enjoyed being part of a project that will continue after I am done with it. I liked that I got to use Ansible as a configuration management system since I had not used it before. 

I did not like the way that Jenkins is configured. I also did not enjoy the near constant coordination problems.

***What did you learn from your teammates?***

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Understanding what those are and how to plan with those in mind is an important part of working together.

***If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done?***

I would be satisfied with the work that was done while feeling that more could have been accomplished.

***If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be working on?***

There are a variety of ways that the build containers and virtual machines could be configured. A more thorough understanding of the needs of projects with regard to building and testing could guide a group to making a number of preconfigured containers and VMs that projects could take advantage of rather than having to specify what needs to be installed in the job configuration.### If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself?
Start early; communicate often. Because we needed to use Agile, but the class was designed for Waterfall, we couldn't do the necessary testing for Agile until Winter, putting our documentation a good bit behind where it should've been. We probably would've done better if we utilized IBM's willingness to help to its fullest potential.

### What's the biggest skill you've learned?
How to communicate directly and effectively. This includes knowing when and how to ask for assistance and how to ask questions in a simple and lucid manner.

### What skills do you see yourself using in the future?
Probably the project management and communication skills, more than anything else.

### What did you like about the project, and what did you not?
I liked that it was different from what the other projects were, as we were developing a service more than a product, and how it was quite different from what we had experienced in classes. On the flip-side, I didn't like how the project had almost nothing in common with the majority of the technical classes I had taken, leaving me without a foundation of relevant knowledge.

### What did you learn from your teammates?
The best way to have a project succeed is to leverage the strengths of each teammate to account for their weaknesses, instead of trying to arbitrarily divide the work up without regards to who is good at what.

### If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done?
I would consider it sufficient for a service that is going to be transitioned to another team for further development and support.

### If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be working on?
Testing, testing, testing. The system could use some stress and scalability testing. It could also do for testing more and more intense builds with more complicated build procedures.
