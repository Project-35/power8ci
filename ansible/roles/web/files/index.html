    <h1>Welcome to the OSL POWER8 Continuous Integration Service!</h1>
    This is the work-in-progress landing page for POWER8 the Continuous 
Integration Service provided by Oregon State University's Open Source 
Labs. This service is designed to provide developers with code 
repositories hosted on GitHub access to a Jenkins build server that will
 provide continuous integration services on IBM's POWER8 processor 
architecture.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    Many developers do not have access to IBM's POWER8 infrastructure 
for building and testing their codebases. Our goal is to expand the 
availability of POWER8 to developers so that they can ensure their 
software can run on a wider variety of platforms.
      
    <h2>Description</h2>
    The OSL hosts a Jenkins server on a OpenStack cluster that runs on 
POWER8 servers. Users can request access to register one or more GitHub 
repositories on the Jenkins server, where they can configure the build 
process and the environment as needed. Builds will run in a Docker 
container by default, but can also be ran in a virtual machine if need 
be. They can also configure the system to run their tests, package any 
necessary files and binaries after running the build, and archive the 
build artifacts on the Jenkins server for later access. The service also
 supports providing e-mail notifications on build status and embedded 
build-notification for webpages.

    <h2>Accessing the service</h2>
    Users will need to register with the OSL before they can access the 
Jekins server. Registration is not open yet, but it is planned to be 
available at <a href="https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/">osuosl.org/services/powerdev</a>. After registering, users can access the Jenkins service at <a href="http://power-ci.osuosl.org:8080/">power-ci.osuosl.org:8080</a>. 

    <h3>GitHub Repository</h3>
    The service is mostly configured and deployed with Ansible through a
 playbook. The playbook is open-source and is available at <a href="https://github.com/Project-35/power8ci">https://github.com/Project-35/power8ci</a>.
